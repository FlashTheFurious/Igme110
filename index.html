            <h2> Why I chose this topic</h2>
            I have been console gamer since I was 6 years old, my first console being the “Playstation 2” so the topic
            definitely hits home for me. After doing research on my previously decided topic , which was “Console vs Pc”
            , I
            discovered that not only am I not including a major platform, but also that this 3rd platform (mobile
            gaming) is
            what could be described as the most profitable platform for developers. I will be basing the research paper
            on
            evidence rather than personal opinion and will try to keep some of the controversial topics in this matter
            out
            of the argument.

            <h2> What I mean by “better”</h2>
            What I mean by better is not the comparison of the quality of the platforms or the level of gameplay
            associated
            with them. What I mean by better is strictly the accessibility , potential market / potential audience ,
            cost to
            develop and sales from the final product . I am not making the claim that the platform of mobile is better
            than
            console and/or PC.

            <h2> Reasons for my claim </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gaming has an exponentially larger audience than PC and Console.</li>
                <li>Developing for mobile requires less resources and time</li>
                <li>It is easier to publish on mobile than it is on console.</li>
                <li>Games can be played in intervals and do not typically require continuous sessions</li>
                <li>Mobile game development sees much more profitability for indie developers and studios .</li>

            </ol>
            <h2> Reasons against my claim</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>PC And Console Gaming can run games better</li>
                <li>Microtransactions run much more wild in mobile games than PC or Console</li>
                <li>Mobile games typically have very limited depth to them</li>
                <li>Mobile gaming has a lot of plagiarism</li>
                <li>Mobile games have a bad reputation for being addictive</li>
            </ol>
