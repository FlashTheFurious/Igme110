            <h2>Quality of gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                While it is true that Console and PC can not only run games better but also provide a much more
                enriching
                user
                experience with regards to video games as compared to mobile games , that is not the argument I am
                trying to
                make here . My argument is not about the quality of the games produced but solely focused on the
                platform
                that
                is better for a game developer to produce on.

            <h2>Microtransactions</h2>

            <p>
                While this statement is true , I will make a point relating to the business model that revolves around a
                game on
                mobile versus the business model behind Console and PC games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically on Console and PC , the business model is to buy either a complete game upfront , or buying
                the
                game
                upfront and then choosing to pay for specific DLC content later on as it releases. Some of the newer
                games
                that
                are free to play , such as fortnite or apex legends , mainly gain profit from microtransactions as well.
                Rarely
                do ANY of the games on these platforms depend on revenue from advertisements.
            </p>
            <p>
                While in the case of mobile games , most games are free to play. If they do cost money it usually ranges
                from
                $1-$2. The games on mobile get their revenue either from advertisements or through microtransactions.

                While some may argue that the concept of microtransactions is wrong , it is this very concept that
                allows
                developers to release free to play games.
            </p>

            <h2>Complexity of Games</h2>

            <p>
                <b> Mobile Games typically have much less depth/complexity to them </b>
                This is not only due to the nature of the games typically published on mobile but also the nature of the
                platform. Mobile games do not support the creation of very complex and high graphic games that we see on
                console
                and PC. However , this only makes my claim stronger , rather than being a counterpoint to my argument.
                Lower
                complexity games means less time spent on development , which further translates to lower development
                costs.
            </p>




            <h2>Plagiarism in games</h2>
            <p>
                Plagiarism is much more common in mobile games. While plagiarism does hurt the developers sales at the
                end of
                the day , there is nothing we can do about it. Video game ideas cannot be copyrighted or owned .
                <b><u>This acts as both a gift and a curse to the industry.</u></b> It acts as a gift because it allows
                the
                industry to experiment and evolve ideas that eventually benefit the players in the end. Without this
                there would
                probably only be 1 game of each category. It also acts as a curse because it sinks into the developers
                profits because
                if the players are given a choice between 15 games of the same genre , they might not pick the game that
                was the
                original trend setter of the genre.

            <h2>Addictive aspect of games </h2>
            <p>
                Mobile games have a bad reputation for being addictive . This is true because of the way mobile games
                are
                typically structured. What I mean by structured is that they are designed to make the player return
                every
                day by
                offering some sort of in-game incentive and constantly updating the game with new objectives so that the
                player
                never runs out of things to do . However , this is a matter of ethics in game development . In fact ,
                this
                has
                no negative effect on the sales of the developers at all.<i> (Salehan, M., & Negahban, A. (2013))</i>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                With the data analysis , it is safe to say that the following are facts about the development of games
                on
                mobile
                :
